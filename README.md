This is my submission for the Module 4 Lesson 3 assignment. 
It's a very simple budget_category class with private attributes 'category_name' and 'allocated_budget'.
This class also includes getter and setter methods for each of the private attributes in order to safely read and update the values of each.
Along with these methods there are methods to include an expense to subtract from the budget and display to show the current budget of allocated category.  
As you can see, there is the module with the class and methods names 'budget_category' and the 'main' module for testing and importing. 
The 'main' module just has the import call and a couple of test categories to show that all methods work. 
Thank you!
